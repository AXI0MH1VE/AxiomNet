The problem statement describes a high-assurance data analysis/verification engine with MCP tool integration, financial data processing, and audit trails. AxiomNet is a Layer 3 overlay network daemon implementing hyperbolic routing over UDP with Noise Protocol encryption. There is zero architectural overlap. Implementing the requested system would require abandoning the entire networking codebase and fundamentally changing the project's purpose. This appears to be either: (1) requirements meant for a different repository, (2) a test of scope recognition, or (3) a naming confusion between two unrelated 'Axiom' projects.",
